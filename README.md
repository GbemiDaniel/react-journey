# 🛠️ React Journey — From Curiosity to Craft

This repo is my personal journey through learning React.

It's not a tutorial.
It's not perfect.
It's **me**, showing up every day, building, breaking things, and becoming better.

## ✨ Why I Started This

I wanted to **understand** how real web apps are built.  
Not just follow tutorials. Not just copy-paste.  
I wanted to _think_ in components. To write code that made sense.  
To build things that worked.

## 🚶‍♂️ How I’m Doing It

I'm learning React using Jonas Schmedtmann’s course on Udemy —  
but more importantly, I'm documenting my **growth** here.

Each folder represents a milestone — a concept, a project, or a mistake that taught me something valuable.

You’ll see my rough drafts. My wins. My learning curves.

## 📂 My React Timeline

- `01-why-frameworks`: Where it all began — understanding the *why* behind React
- `02-what-is-react`: Realizing React is more than just a library — it’s a mindset
- `03-project-setup`: Getting my hands dirty with setup, configs, and dev tools
- `04-components-jsx`: Learning to break UI into pieces I can control
- `05-state-intro`: The first “aha!” moment — how UI reacts to data
- ...and the rest, unfolding week by week.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Beyond the Code

- Patience: Things rarely work the first time.
- Clarity: Naming things well makes everything easier.
- Focus: Debugging teaches you more than success.
- Momentum: Tiny daily progress beats huge random bursts.

## 🌱 Where I’m Headed

This repo will keep growing — just like me.  
More complex projects. Deeper understanding.  
Eventually, **real apps I’m proud of**.

Maybe one day, I’ll look back at these first commits and smile at how far I’ve come.
