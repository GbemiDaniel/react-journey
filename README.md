# 🛠️ React Journey — From Curiosity to Craft

This repo is my personal journey through learning React.

It's not a tutorial.
It's not perfect.
It's **me**, showing up every day, building, breaking things, and becoming better.

---

## ✨ Why I Started This

I wanted to **understand** how real web apps are built.  
Not just follow tutorials. Not just copy-paste.  
I wanted to _think_ in components. To write code that made sense.  
To build things that worked.

---

## 🚶‍♂️ How I’m Doing It

I'm learning React using Jonas Schmedtmann’s course on Udemy —  
but more importantly, I'm documenting my **growth** here.

Each folder represents a milestone — a concept, a project, or a mistake that taught me something valuable.

You’ll see my rough drafts. My wins. My learning curves.

## 📂 My React Timeline

- `01-pure-react`: Basic React setup using only React and ReactDOM, no build tools. Demonstrates core concepts like JSX, rendering, and state.
- `02-JS-review`: JavaScript fundamentals review. Contains practice scripts for ES6 features, array/object manipulation, and async code.
- `03-pizza-menu`:A simple pizza menu app. Practices props, mapping data, conditional rendering, and basic styling in React.
- `04-steps`: Step-by-step UI component. Focuses on state management, conditional rendering, and user interaction.
- `05-Travel- list`: Travel packing list app. Features adding, removing, and toggling items. Practices forms, state updates, and component composition.
  = `06-Eat-N-Split` : Bill splitting app for friends. Practices state, forms, conditional rendering, and updating lists in React.
- ...and the rest, unfolding week by week.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Beyond the Code

- Patience: Things rarely work the first time.
- Clarity: Naming things well makes everything easier.
- Focus: Debugging teaches you more than success.
- Momentum: Tiny daily progress beats huge random bursts.

## 🌱 Where I’m Headed

This repo will keep growing — just like me.  
More complex projects. Deeper understanding.  
Eventually, **real apps I’m proud of**.

Maybe one day, I’ll look back at these first commits and smile at how far I’ve come.

## 🚀 How to run a project

Each project is self-contained and created with **Create React App** (CRA):

```bash
cd [project-folder]
npm install
npm start
```

## 🙌 If You’re Reading This...

Thanks for passing by.  
If you’re learning too — don’t quit.  
We’re all figuring it out.
